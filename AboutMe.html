            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>My name is Ethan Slade and i wa born and raised in gloucesterhsire <br> which continues to be my home today <br>
            When i was<br> younger i began my career working in boswells coffee shop where <br> i learnt tricks of the trade and got my first look on the real world <br>
            After this i Worked really hard during my training in the <br> public services sector which didnt go well but allowed me to learn a lot about me<br>
            In my life so far i ahve learnt tnothing worth having is worth having unless  <br>you can sacrifice all you want know to attain soemthing better.</p>

        <!---THE FOLLOWING IS WHY I DO CODING -->
        <div class="contentBlock-2">
            <div>
            <h2>Why i choose to code?</h2>
            <p>When i was younger i had a very diffreint outlook<br> on the world however as i have gotten older i find i prefer the simple approach of getting <br>soemthing right or wrong but undertsanding its okay to suffer from both.<br>
                This led me to<br> align towards coding as i have found peace in writing it to me it feels <br>much more like my own launguage than the one i speak. <br>i love doing projects and solving prioblems that help me develop my mind <br> to mould and craft wonders.
